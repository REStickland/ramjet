For the new visitors who might now be accessing this code, please note that the repository was setup as a quick solution for a couple tasks and is still changing pretty rapidly. The current methods were the easiest first solution, and are not particularly elegant (for example, an LSTM probably makes more sense than the current 1D CNN). There are a few quick hacks and a few obsolete parts lying around. The cleanup process is underway though, and now that a working model exists we are starting on better solutions.
